# Zero Trust Summary
Zero trust mindset revolves adaptive security policies that embraces the constantly changing work environment requirements and risk profile, and creates policies to always verify based on most latest available information.

Very broadly speaking it involves:
* Provide only sufficient permissions for the job. 
* Instead of believing everything behind corporate firewall is safe, starting with assumption that the request is coming from unsafe conditions and then find reason to trust. 
* Constantly monitoring and creating policies to assess and audit all crucial aspects of security setup. 

It's a great concept and a north-star to work towards, however organisations need to approach the implementation of required security policies with proper planning. We need to ensure that various foundational elements of our enterprise are: (1) connected, (2) constantly monitored and (3) contribute towards access and compliance decision-making. Not only that, we need to be able to leverage all these planes of control as a enforcement mechanism as well.

First step towards that is education and awareness of what's possible with modern security solutions. To that end, Microsoft recently published a couple of assets to [describe their deployment guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security/zero-trust/) with zero trust mindset and a tool for an organisation to [self-assess their current maturity state](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/zero-trust/maturity-model-assessment-tool).

If you are after a summarised version of deployment guidelines, I created a one-page summary of recommended actions and configurations (ok, 2-pages with footnotes and links for further read). It covers all the foundational domains covered of interest, i.e.:
* Identity
* Endpoints
* Data
* Apps
* Infra
* Network
